    <h1>Hunter</h1>
    <p>The Hunter class is represented by Rexxar and Alleria Windrunner. Hunters are known as the tamers of the wilds, commanding various beasts to do their bidding. They are also masters of all kinds of ranged weaponry such as bows or guns and are adept at using traps to harm their foes. Hunters can really punish their opponents for overextending on the board through spells like Explosive Trap and Unleash the Hounds, should they play many minions at the same time.
