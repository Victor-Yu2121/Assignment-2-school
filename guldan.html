    <h1>Warlock</h1>
    <p>The Warlock class is represented by Gul'dan. Known as practitioners of dark arts, Warlocks call upon powerful demons and shadowy spells to aid them in exchange for their own life and more. Most of their cards in Hearthstone have a lower mana cost than their neutral counterparts, but have an additional cost like Health or discarding cards.
